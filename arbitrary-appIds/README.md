# Launch an arbirary app

Prompted by this question on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/q/78232507/399007

We want to launch apps based on an appId, but want to determine that app at runtime. We can't set the `appId` of the test, but that doesn't stop us from launching arbitrary apps using the `launchApp` function.
